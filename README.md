A simple tool to detect the link of mp4 video from Safari. To get the link of video, make sure that Safari has loaded the video first (when you find the default play video icon is available). Tap Safari Share Action icon, make sure you added VideoMarks's extension. Then you can grab the video link with the extension. You can copy the link to pasteboard, or save the link to the app, and watch it later.

The app supports 'Picture In Picture' on iPad, You can watch saved mp4 links in PiP player, and change video through iPad slide over. Video play supports looping, which is useful when playing gif-like videos.

Support: Youtube, Gfycat, Twitter, Tumblr, Bilibili, Miaopai, etc.
